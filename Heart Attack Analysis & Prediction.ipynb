    "An ECG (Electrocardiogram) is a medical test that measures the electrical signals of the heart and is essential for diagnosing many heart related diseases. A healthy individual's heartbeat on an ECG is characterized by a distinctive waveform, representing the normal functioning of the heart.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when the heart is not functioning optimally, the ECG detects distortions to the anticipated waveform, severe and life-threatening arrhythmias might present a different or nonexistent waveform altogether.\n",

    "This project attempts to use supervised machine learning techniques to classify ECG data as either healthy or as one of four different kinds of arrhythmia."
